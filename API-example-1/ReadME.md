#   (API-example-1) - This was my most recent API that I made as a part of a mock trading exchange where users would theoretically sign up and buy or sell a particular contract. It contains about 2000-3000 lines of code and took me approximately 2 weeks to make. You can find the user documentation here made through postman:
