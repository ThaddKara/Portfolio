  - (API-example-3) - This is a separate project from about 1 year ago which was at the end of the pipeline that we talked about during the interview. At this point data has already been fetched, transformed, stored and this API exposes that transformed data and makes it available to a user. It contains approximately 5000 lines of code and took 1-2 weeks to make. This code also contains lots of logical flow and certain parts of it were copy-pasted from other parts of code. It also has a lot of wrappers for AWS services. If I had to go back and change this codebase I would make some generalized functions to reduce the clutter and obviously make it more manageable. You can find the user documentation here made through postman:
